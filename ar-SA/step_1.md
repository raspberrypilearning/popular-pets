## Introduction

In this project you will create computer generated modern art. You will use functions to write code that you can use over and over again.

## Introduction:

This project introduces functions through a colourful modern art generator. Functions are used to package useful turtle graphics code which can then easily be used to create funky art.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

* ['Modern Art' starting point -- jumpto.cc/modern-go](http://jumpto.cc/modern-go)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

* ['Modern Art' Finished -- rpf.io/modern-finished](https://rpf.io/modern-finished)

## Offline Resources

This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

* modern-art/modern-art.py
* modern-art/snippets.py

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

* modern-art-finished/modern-art.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

* Functions;

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

* [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

* Turtle art - define a new function to complete the turtle art generator.
* More modern art - create a new function that calls other functions to generate modern art.

## Frequently Asked Questions

* To avoid having to wait for earlier code to run when adding to the project children can comment out code using a '#' at the beginning of a line.
* If they do want all of their code to run then `clear()` can be used to clear the screen.
